# Broken Social Media Links POC

## Overview
This is a Proof of Concept (POC) website designed to demonstrate broken or invalid social media links. The project showcases how web applications handle dead links, 404 errors, and non-existent profiles across various social media platforms.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this POC is to:
- **Test Link Validation**: Demonstrate how applications behave when social media links point to non-existent profiles
- **Error Handling**: Show different error responses from various social platforms (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram)
- **User Experience Research**: Study how users interact with broken social media links
- **Quality Assurance**: Provide a testing ground for link checking tools and validators

## Features
- **Intentionally Broken Links**: All social media links point to non-existent profiles with random usernames
- **Realistic UI**: Professional-looking social media link interface that mimics real social link pages
- **Multiple Platforms**: Covers major platforms including GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and email
- **Animated Background**: Neo dark purple particle animation system for visual appeal
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes and devices

## Broken Links Included
- **GitHub**: `https://github.com/nonexistent-user-xyz-12345-broken-link-demo`
- **LinkedIn**: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/invalid-profile-broken-link-demo-xyz789/`
- **Twitter**: `https://twitter.com/nonexistent_user_broken_link_demo_12345`
- **Instagram**: `https://www.instagram.com/broken_link_demo_invalid_user_xyz123456789/`
- **Email**: `broken-demo-invalid@nonexistent-domain-xyz123.com`

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Styling**: Dark purple and black theme with gradient backgrounds
- **Animation**: Canvas-based particle system with interconnected nodes
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly design with proper viewport handling

## Use Cases
1. **QA Testing**: Test how link validation tools detect broken social media links
2. **Error Handling**: Study platform-specific 404 error pages and responses
3. **User Research**: Observe user behavior when encountering broken links
4. **Development**: Test social media integration error scenarios
5. **Security Testing**: Analyze how applications handle malformed or invalid URLs

## Getting Started
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Click on any social media link to see the broken link behavior
3. Observe how different platforms handle non-existent profiles
4. Use browser developer tools to monitor network requests and responses

## Note
This is purely for educational and testing purposes. All links are intentionally broken and do not represent real profiles or services.
